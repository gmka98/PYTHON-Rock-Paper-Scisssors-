# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS !

## Popular Game With Python


I created a simple game of rock-paper-scissors using Python. First, I imported the "random" and "enum" modules. I defined the possible actions as an enumerated data type called "Action", where each action is assigned an integer value. Then, I created a list of possible actions as strings.

Next, I set up an infinite loop to keep the game running until the user chooses to quit. Inside the loop, I prompt the user to make a choice and convert it to uppercase for consistency. I also randomly choose an action for the computer using the "random" module.

Then, I compare the user's choice and the computer's choice to determine the winner. If they both choose the same action, it's a tie. Otherwise, I use a series of conditional statements to determine the winner based on the rules of rock-paper-scissors.

After each game, I ask the user if they want to play again. If they don't, the loop breaks and the program ends.
